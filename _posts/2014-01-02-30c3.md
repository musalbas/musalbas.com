I recently attended the [30th Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Main_Page) in Hamburg, Germany. It was the first Chaos Communication Congress I've attended, and it was a lot of fun. The atmosphere was great and everyone was really friendly.

10/10 would go again.

I also did a lightening talk about man-in-the-middle attacks performed by the Tunisian government during the Arab spring, to phish the usernames and passwords of activists on social media websites and email. [The slides are available here.](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/images/b/b9/LT-NSA-like_Surveillance_by_a_Third_World_Country.pdf)
