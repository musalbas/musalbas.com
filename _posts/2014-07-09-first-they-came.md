First they came for the [sysadmins](http://www.zdnet.com/nsa-targets-sysadmin-personal-accounts-to-exploit-networks-7000027553/), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a syadmin.

Then they came for the [Tor users](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28162273), and I did not speak out—<br>

Then they came for the [journalists](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/316751-snowden-nsa-targeted-journalists-critical-of-government-after-911), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a journalist.

Then they came for the [Muslim civil rights leaders](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/07/09/under-surveillance/), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a Muslim civil rights leader.

Then they came for the [politically active](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/09/nsa-glenn-greenwald_n_5545686.html), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not politically active.

Then they came for the [World of Warcraft players](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/09/tech/web/nsa-spying-video-games/), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a World of Warcraft player.

Then they came for the [Cubans](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/04/04/cuban-twitter-scam-social-media-tool-disseminating-government-propaganda/), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a Cuban.

Then they came for the [Bahamians](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/20/bahamas-wants-know-nsa-recording-phone-calls/), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a Bahamian.

Then they came for the [protest groups](http://boingboing.net/2014/02/25/nsa-and-gchqs-dirty-tricking.html), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not in a protest group.

Then they came for the [wankers](http://leaksource.info/2013/11/27/pornint-nsa-spies-on-porn-habits-as-part-of-plan-to-discredit-radicalizers/), and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a wanker (but they are).

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
