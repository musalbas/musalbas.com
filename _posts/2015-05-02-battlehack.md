title: My humble opinion of BattleHack

I recently attended [BattleHack](https://2015.battlehack.org/) London. It was one of the most misleading and dishonest hackathons I've
ever been to.

If you who don't know what BattleHack
is: it's a worldwide series of hackathons hosted by Braintree, a company owned by PayPal. The tag line is "are you the ultimate hacker for good?" and the advertised aim
is to “help your community”. Winners of each BattleHack are
flown to the world final BattleHack each year for a chance to win $100,000.

Sounds great, right? A hackathon where developers come together to make the
world a better place. Except there's one thing that there's no mention of
anywhere on the website, marketing material or registration form. Something
that's hidden in the 5-page terms and conditions, and you'll probably only find
out when you arrive at the actual event - even if you've taken the trouble to
fly in from another country.

And it's this: in order to pitch your hack or be eligible for one of the prizes,
you must use the PayPal or Braintree API.

Now, there's nothing directly wrong with a hackathon solely aimed at developers
to develop applications using a company's API (well, except that it's basically
a prolonged product evangelism event that makes developers promote a company's
product for free over the weekend in exchange for free food, that some genius
decided to call a “hackathon” - but it's up to if that's your cup of tea).
Companies do this all the time, and at least they're honest about it - such as
with Dropbox Hackathon or Facebook Hackathon.

The difference with BattleHack is that PayPal isn't honest about it, so I felt
lured by BattleHack's super-fancy branding and innocent theme of
"helping your community".

I was excited to see what charitable
hacks other hackers would come up with. However, once many of them found out that the use of the PayPal or Braintree API was required,
they had to either a) change their idea entirely so that it somehow benefits
PayPal's business models through the use of the APIs or b) continue with their
original idea, but implement the PayPal or Braintree API in some lame way.

If BattleHack was truly a hackathon for helping the community as it's so
thoroughly marketed as such – why can't they make the use of the PayPal or Braintree API
optional? Well, probably because PayPal's entire motivation for this is to get
more developers using their APIs, not to actually make the world better place.
Shock, horror(!)

But to create an event purposed to get more developers to use your APIs - and
to brand it as an event for "helping your community", is absolutely
disgusting and dishonest.

Really, if BattleHack was actually called "PayPalHack" or
"BraintreeHack", I wouldn't even be writing this right now. That's what it
should be called, except of course it's not, because a hackathon where the sole
purpose is to develop applications using PayPal's APIs (which is what BattleHack
is) would be super-super-super lame.

Frankly, the only reason you should ever go to BattleHack is to abuse PayPal's
free food, beer, WiFi and electricity. And to chill out with friends.

On a side note, as hackers, we do have a moral duty to make the world a better
place and not to do things for free for corporations just because they give us
free food and beer. In this particular case, creating even more applications using PayPal
and extending the cartel they have over online payments certainly is not
"helping the community". PayPal is a company with a long [history](https://stallman.org/articles/kettling-wikileaks.html) of
[harmful](http://www.paypalsucks.com/) [practices](http://money.howstuffworks.com/paypal7.htm). If we really want to "help the
community", we should be creating and encouraging alternatives to PayPal - not making them
even more of a monopoly!

Get a grip, PayPal/Braintree. Have a long and hard think about what you're doing.
